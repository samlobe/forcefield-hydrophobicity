Some notes on how using ff03w differs from e.g. ff03 or ff99SB.

1. The tip4p2005 water model is not in the list of water models
	in pdb2gmx (this list is hard coded). You need to therefore
	use standard tip4p to generate the topology, but then 
	switch the 'tip4p.itp' file included in your system .itp
	file with 'tip4p2005.itp'

2. When generating a solvent box, with genbox, use the option
	'-cs amber03w.ff/tip4p2005.gro'
	(The geometries of tip4p2005 and tip4p are different)

3. Be aware that any unfolded/disordered chains may be less
	collapsed than with ff99SBabcxyz or ff03, so you may 
	need to use a larger box.
